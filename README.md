**Features:**

* Generates random computer choices.
* Implements basic game logic with win/loss/tie conditions.
* Includes a time limit for player input.
* Tracks player and computer scores.

**How to Run:**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the generated executable.

**Gameplay:**

1. The game will display a welcome message and a time limit.
2. The player selects an option (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer generates a random choice.
4. The winner is determined and displayed.
5. The game continues until the player chooses to stop.

**Known Issues:**

* The time limit might not be perfectly accurate due to system performance.
* Error handling for invalid user input is not implemented.

**Future Improvements:**

* Implement more accurate time measurement.
* Add error handling for invalid input.
* Introduce different game modes or difficulty levels.
